# EgFreeCAD
FreeCAD scripting examples with testing

Still trying to figure out github pages.

Absolute links seem to be a problem but rel one
<a href="source/index.rst">rel index.rst</a>.

And no luck list files in a directory.

The link to generated gh-pages should be
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">For freecad with Python-2.7</a>,
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">for freecad with Python-3.6</a>,
<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">for freecad-daily with Python-2.7</a>,
and
<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">for freecad-daily with Python-3.6</a>.
