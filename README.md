# EgFreeCAD
FreeCAD scripting examples with testing

Still trying to figure out github pages. This is README.md from gh-pages branch.

Absolute links seem to be a problem but rel ones work
<a href="source/index.rst">rel index.rst</a>.

And no luck listing files in a directory.

The link to generated gh-pages should be
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">for freecad with Python-2.7</a>, 
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">for freecad with Python-3.6</a>, 
<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">for freecad-daily with Python-2.7<
/a>, 
and 
<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">for freecad-daily with Python-3.6<
/a>.

or in markdown syntax
[for freecad-daily with Python-3.6](build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html)

```
 and ![Image](src)
```

and some notes from   Welcome to GitHub Pages
