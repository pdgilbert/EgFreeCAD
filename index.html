# EgFreeCAD
FreeCAD scripting examples with testing

Still trying to figure out github pages. This is README.md from master branch again, and again.

Notes: 
From the respoistory view of README.md the absolute link works, going to the gh page,  and the relative link does not, giving 404.
From the gh page view of README.md converted to index.html, both work.

Absolute link 
<a href="https://pdgilbert.github.io/EgFreeCAD/index.html">abs index to self</a>.
rel one
<a href="index.html">rel index to self</a>.

And no luck listng files in a directory.

The link to generated gh-pages should be
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">for freecad with Python-2.7</a>, 
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">for freecad with Python-3.6</a>, 
<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">for freecad-daily with Python-2.7<
/a>, 
and
<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">for freecad-daily with Python-3.6<
/a>.
or in markdown syntax
[for freecad-daily with Python-3.6](build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html)

```
