<H1>FreeCAD scripting examples with testing</H1>

Still trying to figure out github pages. This is index.html from gh-pages branch.

The links to generated gh-pages should be<P>
<a href="build_freecad/Python-2.7/html">RELfor freecad with Python-2.7</a>, 

<a href="build_freecad/Python-3.6/html">for freecad with Python-3.6</a>, 

<a href="https://pdgilbert.github.io/EgFreeCAD/build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html">ABS for freecad-daily with Python-2.7<
/a>,
 
and

<a href="build_freecad-daily/Python-3.6/html">for freecad-daily with Python-3.6<
/a>.

or in markdown syntax

[for freecad-daily with Python-3.6](build_freecad-daily/Python-2.7/html)

```
 and ![Image](src)
```

<H2>Notes on this Github Pages setup:</H2>

This <i>index.html</i> file is in the top level directory of the repository gh-pages branch. It is also necessary to have a file <i>.nojekyll</i> in that directory (no file contents necessary) in order that the Sphinx builds do not get processed by Jekyll and lose their CSS setup. The additional result of the <i>.nojekyll</i> file is that the <i>README.md</i> file does not get processed into an <i>index.html</i> file for the website top leval. So an <i>index.html</i> file is needed.
 
Relative links on this page
<a href="index.html">go to the web site (this page)</a>.
It is also possible to use markdown syntax `[text](url)` as in

[go to the web site (this page)](index.html), and for images

```
 ![Image](src)
```

The links to Sphinx build pages (should) work with relative links from this page. 

To go to the the 
<a href="https://github.com/pdgilbert/EgFreeCAD/tree/gh-pages">repository gh-pages branch source files</a>
it is necessary to use absolute links.

Absolute links from this page 
<a href="https://pdgilbert.github.io/EgFreeCAD/index.html">go to the web site</a>

So far no luck listing files in a directory on the web site.<P>
