<H2>FreeCAD scripting examples with testing</H2>

(This is a work in progress. May, 2019)<P>

The view links below go to documents generated with Sphinx using different versions
of FreeCAD and Python. The documents include extensive use of Sphinx doctest
so if the generated document is available at the link then you can be 
relatively certain that
the examples will work in the indicated version of FreeCAD and Python.<P>

<P>
Eventually I hope to have actual version numbers for FreeCAD indicated above,
and archived older versions here...<P>

The table above is continuously rebuilt. Some other systems are tested
occasionally, or have been with older versions of the examples and worked:

<ul>
  <li>FreeCAD 0.18.1 on Mint 18.1 (Ubuntu xenial) works with Python 2 but not Python 3.</li>
  <li>FreeCAD 0.17.1 on Ubuntu 14.04 works with Python 2 but not Python 3.</li>
</ul> 

Other notes:
<ul>
  <li>FreeCAD with Python 3 currently requires at least Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) for proper QT support.</li>
</ul> 

The interaction of git, Travis, Sphinx, FreeCAD versions, Python versions, 
and Github Pages gets a bit messy sometimes, so this page is being 
designed on the KISS principle.<P>

Notes on this Github Page setup and the gh-pages branch
are in the EgFreeCAD
<a href="https://github.com/pdgilbert/EgFreeCAD/tree/gh-pages/README.md">gh-pages branch README.md</a> file.<P>

Notes on the Travis work flow are in the EgFreeCAD
<a href="https://github.com/pdgilbert/EgFreeCAD/README.md">master branch README.md</a> file.<P>

The <a href="https://travis-ci.org/pdgilbert/EgFreeCAD">Travis build job logs</a>
give details about PPAs, distribution packages, etc.<P>

The source code for these documents and examples is maintained on github at
