<H2>FreeCAD scripting examples with testing</H2>

(This is a work in progress. April, 2019)<P>

The view links below go to documents generated with Sphinx using different versions
of FreeCAD and Python. The documents include extensive use of Sphinx doctest
so if the generated document is available at the link then you can be 
relatively certain that
the examples will work in the indicated version of FreeCAD and Python.<P>

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>FC version</th>
  <th>  Python 2.7  </th>
  <th>  Python 3.6  </th>

<P>
Eventually I hope to have actual version numbers for FreeCAD indicated above,
and archived older versions here...<P>

The interaction of git, Travis, Sphinx, FreeCAD versions, Python versions, 
and Github Pages gets a bit messy sometimes, so this page is being 
designed on the KISS principle.<P>

Notes on this Github Page setup, the gh-pages branch, and Travis work 
flow are in the EgFreeCAD
<a href="https://github.com/pdgilbert/EgFreeCAD/tree/gh-pages/README.md">gh-pages README.md</a> file.<P>

The source code for these documents and examples is maintained on github at
<a href="https://github.com/pdgilbert/EgFreeCAD/">EgFreeCAD</a>.
