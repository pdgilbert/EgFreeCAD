The main way to run sphinx is with make in the project directory (EgFreeCAD):

make doctest
make html

File source/conf.py  has all Sphinx settings. It was autogenerated then modified.

The error message 
  "During initialization the error No module named freecad occurred"
means /usr/lib/freecad/lib needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH 

This can be done in the shell before python is started, or in .bashrc, or 
in Makefile, or in source/conf.py (typically around line 18) with
   sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/lib/freecad/lib')

sometime TRY TO FIX THIS:
The error message (in yellow and red)

"No modules found in /usr/lib/freecad-python2/Mod
During initialization the error No module named freecad occurred"

does not seem to prevent make doctest or html.
It also occurs in an interactive python session on a first 'import FreeCAD' 
but then the import seems to modify PYTHONPATH
and the error does not happen on a second call to  import FreeCAD .

>python
import sys, os
#os.environ['PYTHONPATH']
#sys.path
#sys.path.insert(0,os.environ['PYTHONPATH'])
sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/lib/freecad/lib')
import FreeCAD

After module is imported sometimes it's element __file__ says where it came from.
To find what is needed in python and sphinx, start freecad and load modules, eg
import Draft
Draft.__file__

Then in rst file, or conf.py
sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/share/freecad/Mod/Draft/')
